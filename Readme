Program details
---------------
Written on a computer with the following specs:
    CPU:      Intel Core i7-2670QM
    OS:       Ubuntu Linux 13.10 (64 bit)
    Language: C++11
    Compiler: g++ 4.8.1
    IDE:      Netbeans 7.4.3

Compilation Instructions:
-------------------------

To compile open a terminal and change to the directory of the source files, then run the following commands in order:
	make
	mv ./dist/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86/assignment1 ./

* the mv command is necessary because Netbeans places the executable in a separate folder

To run the program use the following command:
	./assignment1 -f %filename%

*Replace %filename% with the name of the database file you would like to use

Usage Instructions
------------------
When the program runs you will be greeted by a menu, simply enter the number of the function you want and press return.

Class explination
------------------

main.cpp:
    This is the main class which contains the menu and main program loop

StudentRecord.cpp, StudentRecord.h:
    The StudentRecord class contains the constructors for StudentRecord objects which hold the data of students.

DataBase.cpp. Database.h:
    The DataBase class holds the list that contains the database entries and all the functions that operate on the database.
    This class also contains the stream operator overloads for StudentRecord objects

cmdline_parser.cpp, cmdline.h: 
    This class is used to get the filename of the database

tokenlib.cpp, tokenlib.h:
    This class is used to assign tokens to student records

counter.h:
    keeps track of the number of student records created and destroyed

Notes
-----
* The program does not automatically create/load a database, you must use the write/read function to do this
* Student Numbers are not case sensitive
* The program will not allow more than one student with the same Student Number
* In most cases the program does not check for incorrect input
